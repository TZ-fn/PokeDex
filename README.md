# PokeDex project

Application project using HTML, JavaScript and CSS. I also used BEM, SCSS and [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/).

You can see Pokemons by a list of 20, search Pokemon either by its number or name, check a random Pokemon or 10 random Pokemons, you can also save favourite Pokemons to localstorage. When you click on any Pokemon name you will be shown a card with details of Pokemon you clicked. Card will include more details for each Pokemon (its evolutions, bigger image, type and a graph with its statistics).
